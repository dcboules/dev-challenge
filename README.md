# DYODE Dev Challenge - Daniel Boules

## Notes

### Approach

I started with the ProductCard, then moved to the carousel. I used the existing design tokens and same naming from App.css so everything stays consistent. The carousel is just flexbox with `overflow-x: auto`, without any external libraries. The layout variation uses a `layout` prop (`default` vs `compact`) that controls how many cards show per breakpoint.

Liquid answers are in `LiquidChallenge.md`.

### Tradeoffs

- I kept the carousel as native scroll. It works on all devices.
- I focused on getting the structure right rather than adding extra interactions.

### With More Time

- I'd add arrow buttons, add image hover effects, and make the carousel loop so it wraps back to the first product after the last one.

## Liquid Challenge

#### These questions should be answered with real world solutions in liquid

##### \*Please provide these answers in written form

1. Describe how you would add an editable text setting to a section using schema, and render it in Liquid. Include both the schema and Liquid example.
2. How would you implement a collection banner using the collection’s featured image in a section that can be reused across templates?
3. In a Shopify section, add a setting that allows a merchant to toggle the visibility of a component (e.g., show/hide a banner). Show both the schema and the Liquid needed to implement this.
4. In a Shopify section, how would you access and render the current product’s title, price, and featured image? Briefly explain the context required for this to work.
5. Using section schema, define a repeatable block (e.g., items with a title and text). Show how you would loop through and render those blocks in Liquid.

## Frontend Challenge

Thanks for taking the time to complete this challenge — we appreciate it.

This exercise is designed to reflect the kind of work you’d be doing with our team: working within an existing codebase, extending components, and making thoughtful improvements.

### Design

[Figma File](https://www.figma.com/design/9xa5hNPjYxs2hGbZCowOMe/DYODE---Dev-Test?node-id=0-1&t=KSk9ZmE74e04SIja-1)

---

### Getting Started

Clone the repository and run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

---

### The Task

You’ll be working within a small React codebase that includes some starter components and data.

#### Your objectives:

#### 1. Complete the Product Carousel

The `ProductCarousel` component is partially implemented.

- Render the provided product data
- Structure the component in a clean, reusable way

---

#### 2. Add a Layout Variation

Extend the `ProductCarousel` component to support a variation via props.

- Example: `compact` vs `default` layout
- Implementation details are up to you

---

#### 3. Styling (Mobile-First)

Apply styling to the Product Carousel to roughly match the provided design.

- Focus on structure and responsiveness
- Pixel perfection is not required

---

#### 4. Refactor the Product Card

The `ProductCard` component is intentionally basic.

- Improve structure and readability
- Make any changes you feel improve the component

---

### Submission

Please provide:

- A link to your GitHub repository
- (Optional) A hosted preview (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- A short README or notes covering:
  - Your approach
  - Any tradeoffs you made
  - What you would improve with more time

---

### Expectations

- This exercise should take approximately **1–2 hours**
- We value **clarity, structure, and thought process** over completeness
- It’s okay to make assumptions — just document them

---

### What We’re Looking For

- Ability to work within an existing codebase
- Clean, readable component structure
- Thoughtful use of props and reusability
- Basic understanding of responsive design
- Clear communication of decisions

---

If anything is unclear, feel free to reach out with questions.

Thanks again — we look forward to reviewing your submission.
